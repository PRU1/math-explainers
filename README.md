# thing-explainers

A place to store pdf files of my math/physics explainers, probably made using LaTeX.

Using this repo as an archive to quickly find final drafts of explainer pieces (in case I lose my files)


Math grade 9 notes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13T6J60pJ8iobVIYVgH7pzOOnXmRPi1PP/view?usp=sharing (file too large to upload to GitHub)

### 2022-2023 School year update
Haven't been up to much. Wrote my physics and math IA though. Not entirely sure if I can post them here, so if you'd like a copy of them please email me at pranavnks@gmail.com
